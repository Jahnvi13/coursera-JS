	<div class="Content">Rajma-chawal is the staple diet of North-India. Composed of Rajma (kidney-beans) cooked in a gravy with mystrious elements poured over chawal (rice), this Indian delicacy is sure to seduce you the moment you meet eyes with it.</div>

<div class="Box secondline">
	<div class="Title">Palak-paneer</div>
	<div class="Content">Paneer (cottage cheese) is the vegetarian version of Chicken, Meat and Fish. It's all that vegetarians have got in the name of protien. A true palak-paneer lover licks the bowl so clean that nobody finds out what it had in the first place.</div>
